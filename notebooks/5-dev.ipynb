The most general derivation process should follow the outline [here](https://wiseodd.github.io/techblog/2018/03/14/natural-gradient/), replacing the KL divergence (which is induced by the log score) with whichever divergence is induced by the scoring rule you want to use (e.g. L2 for CRPS), again taking care to derive with respect to the internal ngboost parameterization, not the user-facing one.
